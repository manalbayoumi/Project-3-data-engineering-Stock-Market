Project 3 â€“ The Use of Data Engineering to Analyze Stock Market Data
Project members: Manal Bayoumi, Rocio Cantu, and Melissa Mosby

Project Overview
Our project will analyze the stock data for Alphabet Inc. (aka Google), Apple Inc., Intel Corporation, Microsoft Corporation, and Oracle Corporation to determine various questions such as:
-	What factors make stock prices rise and fall?
-	What factors influence investors to buy or sell stocks?

Our analysis will follow a data engineering track. We will employ jupyter notebook and pandas to capture and modify our data using ELT workflows. Next, we will feed our data into SQL and MongoDB. Also, we will generate an ERD diagram to show the relationships of our database tables. We will create a method to read our data from the database with pandas dataframe or Flask API. Finally, we will use an additional library to XYZ. 

Project Instructions on How Use and Interaction
Initially, you might need to download the yahoo finance and pandas-datareader packages. In order to do this, please run the following commands in jupyter notebook:
!pip install yfinance
!pip install pandas-datareader



Project Database Documentation
-	Need to explain why we chose SQL or NoSQL.

Project ETL Workflow with ERD and Diagrams
-	Need to provide the ETL workflow and ERD diagram.

Project Ethical Considerations
-	Need to summarize our efforts regarding ethical considerations.
